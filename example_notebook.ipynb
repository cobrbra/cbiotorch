    "One problem when combining multiple datasets (and even sometimes within a single dataset) is that different gene panels are used to profile different samples. This can be a problem for prediction, as it is not necessarily possible to distinguish which genes were unmutated and which were not profiled. In this case, some samples were profiled using the \"IMPACT341\" panel and some using the \"IMPACT410\" panel. What `MutationDataset` does is automatically generate a \"maximal valid gene panel\", i.e pooling all genes which were profiled in all samples across the data. We can see below that this is 341 genes long (i.e. simply the IMPACT341 panel, which is a subset of IMPACT410), and look at some of the genes contained."
